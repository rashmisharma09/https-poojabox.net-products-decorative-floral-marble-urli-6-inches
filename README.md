It seems like you're describing a traditional decorative item. A Floral Diwali Urli with Stand appears to be a piece of Indian decor that combines elements like peacocks, diyas (oil lamps), flowers, and an urli (a shallow decorative bowl) on a stand. This item could potentially be used for festivals, weddings, or as a general decorative piece.
